# How to choose the right category?

If it's something tangible, it might be in the `giongo` category or its subcategory. If not, it'll be in the `gitaigo` category or one of its subcategories.

To give you an idea:

1. `giongo` for **sound effects**.
    1. `giseigo` for **human (hahaha) and animal (pio pio) onomatopoeias**.
2. `gitaigo` for **facial expressions, emotions, textures or manner of action**.
    1. `giyougo` to **describe body language**.
    2. `gijougo` for **emotions and feelings**.

# Onomatopoeia classification

All of the Japanese words for any category have two kanji in common: 擬 at the beginning, meaning "imitate" and 語 at the end, which means "language". As you can see, all of them are "imitate ~ language".

There's two categories: `giongo` and `gitaigo`. Inside `giongo`, you'll find `giseigo` subcat. In `gitaigo`, you'll find `gijougo` and `giyougo`.

- When combined with する without the と in between, it functions as part of the verb する or as an adverb.
- When combined with a verb other than する, it is likely to be an adverb.

## Nature or non-living / Giongo / 擬音語

> `giongo` translated as "imitate sound language" (音 means sound). It can describe any word that sounds like what it is describing.

![giongo](http://blog.gengo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/zaa-zaa.png)

This category will have words that are describing sounds (non-living things). Any sound that doesn't come from a person's or animal's mouth goes here. Things like the sound of a thunder or a little rain will be here. In manga this is called **sound effects**.

### Human-living or animal / Giseigo / 擬声語

> `giseigo` translated as "imitate voice language" (声 means voice). Imitates animal and/or human sounds.

This `giongo` subcategory will have sounds that imitate real-life words (human or animal). Things like "hahaha" or "muuu (cow)" are good examples.

## Conditions and moods / Gitaigo / 擬態語

**No equivalent in English**.

> `gitaigo` translated as "imitate condition language" (態 means condition). This is more abstract and used to describe emotions or facial expressions, textures or manner of action.

![gitaigo](http://blog.gengo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/gusya-gusya.png)

This category will be sounds for conditions or states (human or not). Things like "a sparkle in her eyes" or "lots of sunlight shining" goes here. This is not meant to resemble sounds because action, motion or state makes no sound. **This is commonly used in manga.**

### Movement and action / Giyougo / 擬容語 (ぎようご)

**No equivalent in English**.

> `giyougo` translated as "imitate shape language" (容 means shape). This is a tangible but doesn't describe a sound or action, as it's used to describe body language and things like that.

![giyougo](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FE3aS_FakAIjZ0L.jpg)

This `gitaigo` subcategory is for movement (walking or traveling from one place to another). Things like "being half asleep and nodding off" or "not having the willpower to do something" come here. **This is commonly used in manga.**

### Feelings / Gijougo / 擬情語 (ぎじょうご)

**No equivalent in English**.

> `gijougo` translated as "imitate emotion language" (情 means emotion). This is something abstract since it doesn't define something tangible, but rather feelings and emotions.

![gijougo](https://img-cdn.jg.jugem.jp/445/15130/20060307_141520.jpg)

In this `gitaigo` subcategory you can find emotions. Things like "throbbing, grinding pain" or "happy, joyfully glad and full of hope" come here. **This is commonly used in manga.**
