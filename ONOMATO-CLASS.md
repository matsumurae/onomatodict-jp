# How to choose the right category?

If it's something tangible, it might be in the `giongo` category or its subcategory. If not, it'll be in the `gitaigo` category or one of its subcategories.

To give you an idea:

1. `giongo` includes everything that has a sound source (ie you can hear the sound).
     1. `giongo` is the category for **sound effects**. Basically noise.
     2. `giseigo` for **human (hahaha) and animal (pio pio) onomatopoeias**. In short, voices.
2. `gitaigo` includes anything that comes from a soundless source (ie you won't hear any noise here).
     1. `gitaigo` is the category for the **states and actions of inanimate beings**.
     2. `giyougo` to **describe states and actions of animate beings**.
     3. `gijougo` for **human emotions and feelings**.

# Onomatopoeia classification

![Clasificación](https://i.imgur.com/vcB6cMs.png)

All of the Japanese words for any category have two kanji in common: 擬 at the beginning, meaning "imitate" and 語 at the end, which means "language". As you can see, all of them are "imitate ~ language".

There's two categories: `giongo` and `gitaigo`. Inside `giongo`, you'll find `giseigo` subcat. In `gitaigo`, you'll find `gijougo` and `giyougo`.

- When combined with する without the と in between, it functions as part of the verb する or as an adverb.
- When combined with a verb other than する, it is likely to be an adverb.

## Nature or non-living / Giongo / 擬音語

> `giongo` translated as "imitate sound language" (音 means sound). It can describe any word that sounds like what it is describing.

![giongo](http://blog.gengo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/zaa-zaa.png)

This category encompasses words that reproduce sounds from the outside world (non-living sounds). Any sound that doesn't come from a person's or animal's mouth goes here. Things like the sound of a thunder or a little rain will be here. In manga this is called **sound effects**.

### Human-living or animal / Giseigo / 擬声語

> `giseigo` translated as "imitate voice language" (声 means voice). Imitates animal and/or human sounds.

This `giongo` subcategory will have sounds that imitate real-life words (human or animal). Things like "hahaha" or "muuu (cow)" are good examples.

## Conditions and moods / Gitaigo / 擬態語

**No equivalent in English**.

> `gitaigo` translated as "imitate condition language" (態 means condition). This is more abstract and used to describe emotions or facial expressions, textures or manner of action.

![gitaigo](http://blog.gengo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/gusya-gusya.png)

This category will be sounds for conditions or states. **Used for inanimate objects**. Things like "something shiny" or "lots of bright sunlight" go here. It is not intended to resemble sounds because the action, movement, or state does not make sound.

### Movement and action / Giyougo / 擬容語 (ぎようご)

**No equivalent in English**.

> `giyougo` translated as "imitate shape language" (容 means shape). This is a tangible but doesn't describe a sound or action, as it's used to describe body language and things like that.

![giyougo](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FE3aS_FakAIjZ0L.jpg)

This `gitaigo` subcategory is for movement (walking or traveling from one place to another). **Used only for living things**. Things like "being half asleep and nodding off" or "not having the willpower to do something" come here.

### Feelings / Gijougo / 擬情語 (ぎじょうご)

**No equivalent in English**.

> `gijougo` translated as "imitate emotion language" (情 means emotion). This is something abstract since it doesn't define something tangible, but rather feelings and emotions.

![gijougo](https://img-cdn.jg.jugem.jp/445/15130/20060307_141520.jpg)

In this `gitaigo` subcategory you can find emotions. **Used only for humans**. Things like "throbbing, grinding pain" or "happy, joyfully glad and full of hope" come here.

# Onomatopoeia syntax

| Function                 | Example                | Translation              |
|-------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Verbal modification | 疲れ て ふらふら (と) 歩く | Walking with exhaustion |
| Nominal modification | 疲れ て ふらふらの 人 | someone exhausted |
| Copulative predicate | 疲れ て ふらふらだ | be exhausted |
| Predicative complement | 疲れ て ふらふら に なる | Finish exhausted |

## Classification of Japanese adverbs

There are seven categories:

1. **Manner adverb:** ゆっくり (slowly), ぐっすり (deeply / used to sleep), じっと (stare), いやい や (reluctantly), びしびし (strictly).
2. **Degree adverb:** とても (very), もっと (more).
3. **Quantity adverb:** たくさん (much), ほとんど (almost).
4. **Frequency adverb:** いつも (always), 時々 (sometimes), 大 抵 (almost always).
5. **Time adverb:** 今日 (today), 明日 (tomorrow), すぐ (right).
6. **Aspect Adverb:** もう (Ya), とうとう (Finally), 直ち に (immediately).
7. **Sentence Adverb:** ぜひ (Without Missing), おそらく (Probably), 多 分 (Maybe), きっと (Safe), 当然 (Naturally).

If we talk about onomatopoeia, we can find **four categories**: way, result, degree (also includes quantity) and frequency.

### Manner onomatopoeia

> Explain how the action described by the verb is developed.

In Japanese, almost all onomatopoeia can function as adverbs. Some need the particle と to function as adverb.

```
あの 人 美人 な のに 、 どう して に じゃら じゃら と 着飾る の かしら
With how beautiful it is, I do not understand why you dress so strident.

身軽 な は 、 通り かかっ た 私 驚かそう と 、 いきなり 松 木 の枝 から ぴょ んと 飛び 、 地面 に すくっと 立っ て 見せ た た た た た た た た た た た た た た た た た た た た た
Saburo, agile as he is and in an attempt to scare me passing through there, suddenly he went out of the branch of a pine and stood on the ground, just in front of me.
```

### Result onomatopoeia

> They indicate a state that is a consequence of the action of the verb to which they accompany. They do not refer to sounds, if not to states.

```
僕 は たち を 遊園 地 に 連れ て て く たく た に た た
I took the children to the amusement park and ended up dusty.

弟 は に 遭っ た らしくびしょびしょ に 濡れ て 帰宅 た た
My brother returned home soaked after being surprised by a shower.

久方 ぶり 大 掃除 を し て 床 を ぴかぴか 磨い た た
I had not done general cleaning for some time and left the ground shining.
```

### Grade onomatopoeia (+ quantity)

In this amount there are many less than in the previous two.

```
肉 中心 食事 を し て いる 人 は 同時 に 野菜 も たっぷりとら なければなら い い
Those who base their food on meat should also take vegetables in abundance.

田舎 両親 から 大きな 荷物 が 届い た 、 開け て みる と ミカン が どっさり 入っ て い た
I opened the huge package that my parents sent me from the town and I found it full of oranges.
```

### Frequency onomatopoeia

This category is the smallest of the four.

> They indicate that the action in question happens again and again.

```
帰宅 が 近づく と 、 社員 は 壁 かかっ て いる 時計 に ちょい 目 を や る る
As the time is coming home, employees do not stop looking over and over again at the wall.

わから ない があっ たら 、 遠慮 せ ず どしどし 質問 し て ください
If there is something that they do not understand, do not repair to ask all the questions you want.
```
