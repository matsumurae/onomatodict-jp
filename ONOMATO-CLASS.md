# How to choose the right category?

If it's something tangible, it might be in the `giongo` category or its subcategory. If not, it'll be in the `gitaigo` category or one of its subcategories.

To give you an idea:

1. `giongo` includes everything that has a sound source (ie you can hear the sound).
     1. `giongo` is the category for **sound effects**. Basically noise.
     2. `giseigo` for **human (hahaha) and animal (pio pio) onomatopoeias**. In short, voices.
2. `gitaigo` includes anything that comes from a soundless source (ie you won't hear any noise here).
     1. `gitaigo` is the category for the **states and actions of inanimate beings**.
     2. `giyougo` to **describe states and actions of animate beings**.
     3. `gijougo` for **human emotions and feelings**.

# Onomatopoeia classification

![Clasificación](https://i.imgur.com/vcB6cMs.png)

All of the Japanese words for any category have two kanji in common: 擬 at the beginning, meaning "imitate" and 語 at the end, which means "language". As you can see, all of them are "imitate ~ language".

There's two categories: `giongo` and `gitaigo`. Inside `giongo`, you'll find `giseigo` subcat. In `gitaigo`, you'll find `gijougo` and `giyougo`.

- When combined with する without the と in between, it functions as part of the verb する or as an adverb.
- When combined with a verb other than する, it is likely to be an adverb.

## Nature or non-living / Giongo / 擬音語

> `giongo` translated as "imitate sound language" (音 means sound). It can describe any word that sounds like what it is describing.

![giongo](http://blog.gengo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/zaa-zaa.png)

This category encompasses words that reproduce sounds from the outside world (non-living sounds). Any sound that doesn't come from a person's or animal's mouth goes here. Things like the sound of a thunder or a little rain will be here. In manga this is called **sound effects**.

### Human-living or animal / Giseigo / 擬声語

> `giseigo` translated as "imitate voice language" (声 means voice). Imitates animal and/or human sounds.

This `giongo` subcategory will have sounds that imitate real-life words (human or animal). Things like "hahaha" or "muuu (cow)" are good examples.

## Conditions and moods / Gitaigo / 擬態語

**No equivalent in English**.

> `gitaigo` translated as "imitate condition language" (態 means condition). This is more abstract and used to describe emotions or facial expressions, textures or manner of action.

![gitaigo](http://blog.gengo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/gusya-gusya.png)

This category will be sounds for conditions or states. **Used for inanimate objects**. Things like "something shiny" or "lots of bright sunlight" go here. It is not intended to resemble sounds because the action, movement, or state does not make sound.

### Movement and action / Giyougo / 擬容語 (ぎようご)

**No equivalent in English**.

> `giyougo` translated as "imitate shape language" (容 means shape). This is a tangible but doesn't describe a sound or action, as it's used to describe body language and things like that.

![giyougo](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FE3aS_FakAIjZ0L.jpg)

This `gitaigo` subcategory is for movement (walking or traveling from one place to another). **Used only for living things**. Things like "being half asleep and nodding off" or "not having the willpower to do something" come here.

### Feelings / Gijougo / 擬情語 (ぎじょうご)

**No equivalent in English**.

> `gijougo` translated as "imitate emotion language" (情 means emotion). This is something abstract since it doesn't define something tangible, but rather feelings and emotions.

![gijougo](https://img-cdn.jg.jugem.jp/445/15130/20060307_141520.jpg)

In this `gitaigo` subcategory you can find emotions. **Used only for humans**. Things like "throbbing, grinding pain" or "happy, joyfully glad and full of hope" come here.
