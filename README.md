## About Onomatodict

Japanese has onomatopoeia as the core of it's language. There's onomatopoeic words everywhere! Describing sounds, things, feelings… Everything! These words are rooted on the language and it's really **really** hard to get know them if you're not Japanese.

### Why another dictionary

I know there's a lot of resources out there (books, websites, etc) but I had problems with things I need to look for (not only onomatopoeia). My biggest complains are:

1. Need to look deeply to find…
2. If you find it, you'll probably need to look at diff resources to understand it and…
3. Probably, they don't have a visual example so you'll get a catch **even without explanation**.

Having a visual explanation for words / grammar it's really really useful. At least for me, I get better if I see a conversation rather than reading a grammar point (plus I hate this). I'm a visual learner. That's the reason why I started why I started this onomatopoeia project.

### What you'll find

In [this wiki page](https://github.com/matsumurae/onomatodict-jp/wiki/Onomatopoeia-classification) you'll get to know the different onomatopoeia classifications, meaning of each category and a visual example of it. I tried my best to explain each category in a simple and understandable way so everyone can get the real meaning.

You'll know the available words in the [Wiki's homepage](https://github.com/matsumurae/onomatodict-jp/wiki/Home).

#### How to use the dictionary?

Let's say you go to the `N` letter and choose `nico-nico`. You'll find the next info for each word:

- **Describing image:** I try to get them from manga but sometimes it's not easy.
- **Video:** if there's any explanation on YT.
- **Audio:** if there's an available audio for the word.
- **Related:** related onomatopoeias.
- **Meaning:** Real meaning or meanings of the word.
- **Type:** As described in [this wiki page](https://github.com/matsumurae/onomatodict-jp/wiki/Onomatopoeia-classification).
- **Category:** Used to categorize JSON data. MEANINGLESS HERE.
- **Equivalence:** Word equivalence. Sometimes there's no direct equivalence and it's more like a word or list of words that could be used for.
- **Usage:** grammar rules about how it's commonly used. This is not a mandatory rule, it's more a guideline. The words used here are not the only way to use them.
- **Examples:** real-word examples to see how the onomatopoeia is used.
